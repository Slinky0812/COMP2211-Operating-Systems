# COMP2211-Operating-Systems

This is my solution for the COMP2211 Operating Systems Coursework.

The task was to create and implement the functions malloc() and free() for the xv6 system, and to write a report on how we implemented the functions.

I achieveved a grade of 14/14 for the coding task, and a grade of 12/18 for the written report. Since this was worth 20% of my overall grade for the module, and the report being 6%, this meant I achieved a total of 18/20 for this coursework.

I received an overall grade of 72/100 for this module
